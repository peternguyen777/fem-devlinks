**_DevLinks_** is a link-sharing application that simplifies how software developers connect with startups, companies, or recruiters looking for programming talent. It offers a centralized platform to showcase and share various profiles and links, including portfolios, LinkedIn, resumes, GitHub, and other programming-related social media. This full-stack web application is built using the T3 stack, which includes Next.js, TypeScript, TRPC, and Tailwind CSS, prioritizing performance and development speed.

On the front-end, the user interface is constructed with Tailwind and modified shadcn components, featuring a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface and validation through React Hook Form with Zod for data validation. On the backend, APIs are created with TRPC, with data management handled by Prisma ORM in a PlanetScale MySQL database. Custom sign-in/sign-up flows are developed around Clerk authentication, while file uploads are managed through UploadThing, a wrapper for Amazon S3.

DevLinks is currently free to use, allowing users to create a profile at their custom domain. Paid tiers will be developed in the future to expand the product offering, which will include SEO, analytics, and payment integration.
